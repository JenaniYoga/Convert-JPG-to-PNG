# JPG to PNG Converter
This Python script converts JPG images to PNG format using the Pillow library (Python Imaging Library fork).

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the Pillow library by running:
   pip install Pillow
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
4. Place the JPG image you want to convert into the same directory as the script.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
   python Convert_JPG_to_PNG.py
   
6. The converted PNG image will be saved in the same directory with the name "Photo.png".

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (Python Imaging Library fork)

## Notes
- This script assumes that the input JPG file is named "12.jpg" and is located in the same directory as the script. You can modify the script to accept user input for the file path and name if needed.
- Feel free to modify and improve the script according to your requirements.
